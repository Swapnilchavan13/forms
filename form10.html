        <p>I/We, ……………………………………………. and ……………………………………………., consent to freezing
            of the my ………………………….. (sperm/oocyte). We understand that the gametes would be normally kept frozen
            for ten years. In the exceptional circumstances If I/we wish to extend this period, we would let the ART
            clinic
            …………………………………..(Name and address) know at least six months ahead of time. If you do not hear from
            us before that time, you will be free to (a) use them for research purposes; or (b) discard and destroy them
            off. We
            also understand that sometimes the quality of these ………………………………… sperm/occytes may decrease on
            subsequent thaw and that frozen gametes may have a lower pregnancy rate than when fresh gametes are
            transferred.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Provision of Information As long as I have cryopreserved gametes in storage at clinic mentioned
                        above, I hereby agree to contact the
                        above clinic at least annually to provide current information indicating my address, telephone
                        number, email
                        address and contact details and intention regarding my cryopreserved gametes. </li>
                    <p>Failure to:

                    <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                        <li>contact the clinic for a period of twelve months;
                        </li>
                        <li>respond to a request for information from clinic within 90 days of receipt; shall constitute
                            abandonment and signify my desire to terminate storage of Cryopreserved gametes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the event of my failure to comply with (i) and (ii) above, I instruct the above-mentioned
                        clinic and hereby
                        consent to my Cryopreserved gametes either being destroyed and discarded or given for research.
                    </p>

                    <li>Payment of Fees
                    </li>
                    <p>I understand that I am responsible for the costs of cryopreservation and storage of my
                        Cryopreserved
                        gametes. Cryopreservation and storage fees are due and payable at the time of gamete
                        cryopreservation, and
                        at the beginning of each annual storage interval thereafter. I understand these fees are
                        non-refundable and are
                        not subject to prorated adjustment for partial storage intervals. Should the yearly fee for
                        storage of my
                        Cryopreserved gametes, remain unpaid for a period of one year after the first invoice is
                        forwarded to my
                        address/email/informed to me telephonically the clinic can conclude that I am no longer
                        interested in storing
                        these specimen(s) and I hereby instruct the clinic to destroy of my Cryopreserved gametes or use
                        for
                        research.</p>
                    <li>Alternate Contact/Responsible Party</li>
                    <p>I hereby name ………………………………… as an alternate contact and my representative to assume
                        responsibility for sections 1 and 2 above in the event that I am unable due to illness. I have
