        <h4>Consent for Oocyte Retrieval</h4>

        <p>Name(s) and address(es) of patient
        </p>
        <p>Name and address of the Clinic:
        </p>
        <p>I have asked the Clinic named above to provide me with treatment services to help me bear a child. I consent
            to:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Being prepared for oocyte retrieval by the administration of hormones and other drugs</li>
            <li>The removal of oocytes from my ovaries under ultrasound guidance / laparoscopy</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I/We had a full discussion with ………………………………….. about the above procedures and the risks and
            complications involved and I have been given oral and written information about them I understand and accept
            that
            the drugs that are used to stimulate the ovaries to raise oocytes have temporary side-effects like nausea,
            headaches and
            abdominal bloating. Only in a small proportion of cases, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation occurs
            where
            there is an exaggerated ovarian response. Such cases can be identified ahead of time but only to a limited
            extent.
            Further, at times the ovarian response is poor or absent in spite of using a high dose of drugs. Under these
            circumstances, the treatment cycle will be cancelled</p>
        <p>I/We consent that I/we shall be the legal parent(s) of the child and the child will have all the legal rights
            on me, in case
            of anonymous gamete / embryo donation.
        </p>
        <p>I/We have been given a suitable opportunity to take part in counselling about the implications of the
            proposed
            treatment.</p>
        <p>The type of anaesthetic proposed (general / regional / sedation) has been discussed in terms which I have
            understood.</p>
