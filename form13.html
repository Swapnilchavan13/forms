        <h3>FORM 13</h3>
        <h4>[See rule 13 (f) (viii)]</h4>
        <h4>Consent Form for the Donor of Oocytes</h4>

    <div>
        <p>I, Ms. …………………………………………….., Address…………………………………. Mobile
            number…………………………………., AADHAR card number………………………. Willingly consent to donate
            my oocyte to couple/individual who are unable to have a child by other means. At this stage and to the best of my
            knowledge I am free of any infectious diseases or genetic disorders
            </p>
            <p>I have had a full discussion with Dr……………………………………………. (name and address of the clinician) on
                …………………………………………</p>
                <p>I have been counselled by ………………………………………………. (name and address of independent counsellor)
                    on ………………………………………………….. </p>
                    <p>(I understand that there will be no direct or indirect contact between me and the recipient, and my personal identity
                        will not be disclosed to the recipient or to the child born through the use of my gamete.: If applicable)</p>
                        <p>I understand that I shall have no rights whatsoever on the resulting offspring and vice versa</p>
                        <p>I understand that the method of treatment may include:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Stimulating my ovaries for multifollicular development.</li>
                            <li>The recovery of one or more of my eggs under ultrasound-guidance or by laparoscopy under sedation or
                                general anesthesia.</li>
                                <li>The fertilization of my oocytes with recipient’s husband’s or donor sperm and transferring the resulting
                                    embryo into the recipient. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>I understand and accept that the drugs that are used to stimulate the ovaries to raise oocytes have temporary sideeffects like nausea, headaches and abdominal bloating. Only in a small proportion of cases, a condition called ovarian
                            hyperstimulation occurs where there is an exaggerated ovarian response. Such cases can be identified ahead of time
                            but only to a limited extent. Further, at times the ovarian response is poor or absent in spite of using a high dose of
                            drugs. Under these circumstances, the treatment cycle will be cancelled. </p>
