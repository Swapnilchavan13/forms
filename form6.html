    <p>I/We have requested the clinic…………………………………………..…………………………
        …………………………………………………………………..…………. (name and address of clinic) to provide us

    <p>We understand and accept (as applicable) that:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The drugs that are used to stimulate the ovaries for ovulation induction have temporary side- effects like
            nausea,
            headaches and abdominal bloating. Only in a small proportion of cases, a condition called ovarian
            hyperstimulation occurs where there is an exaggerated ovarian response. Such cases can be identified ahead
            of
            time but only to a limited extent. Further, at times the ovarian response is poor or absent in spite of
            using a high
            dose of drugs. Under these circumstances, the treatment cycle will be cancelled.</li>
        <li>There is no guarantee that:
        </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>The oocytes will be retrieved in all cases.</li>
            <li>The oocytes will be fertilized.</li>
            <li>Even if there were fertilization, the resulting embryos would be of suitable quality to be transferred.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All these unforeseen situations will result in the cancellation of any treatment</p>
        <li>I/ We fully consent to these procedures and to the administration of such drugs and anesthetics as may be
            necessary. We also consent to any other operative measures, which may be found to be necessary in the
            course of the treatment.</li>
        <li>I/ We have been told of the risks of ultrasound directed follicle aspiration.</li>
        <li>I/ We are aware that we are free to withdraw or vary the terms of this consent until the gametes and/ or

            request</li>
        <li>There is no certainty that a pregnancy will result from these procedures even in cases where good quality
            embryos are transferred.</li>
        <li>If a clinical pregnancy does result from assisted conception treatment, I/ we understand there is an
            accepted
            risk of multiple pregnancy, an ectopic pregnancy or of a miscarriage. I/ We understand that as in natural
            conception, there is a small risk of fetal abnormality</li>
        <li>Medical and scientific staff can give no assurance that any pregnancy will result in the delivery of a
            normal
            living child.</li>
        <li>The uncertainty of the outcome of the procedure has been fully explained to me/ us.</li>

        <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>it is not possible to guarantee that a follicle will develop in a given cycle and that
                occasionally cycles have to be abandoned before egg retrieva</li>
            <li>there is a risk that spontaneous ovulation can happen prior to/or during the egg retrieval.
            </li>
            <li>an egg is not always recovered from a follicle at the time of egg retrieval.</li>
            <li>any eggs may be collected and fertilization of any collected eggs will occur </li>
